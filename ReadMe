There is a Additional file which is required to import in order to run this projectthis file name is (clf.pkl) 
this is a pickle file however due to the large size i was unable to upload it inthis GItHub repo.
if you want to download the clf.pkl file do follow the following steps:
1) search the file named (Resume screening with Python.ipynb)
2) download the file and import it in your Juypter note book
3) while running the file if you run all the sections, you will eventually generate both tfidf.pkl and clf.pkl file and 
that can be viewed in your home section of juypter notebook.
